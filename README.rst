Description
===========

This is Django based website that allows people to inspect the results
of a LOFAR transients pipeline run. It will show light curves and
images for found transients (in fact, all found sources), as well as
some diagnostics.

It's main purposes currently is to provide an easy way for people to
browse through the data obtained from a transients pipeline run.


Installation
============

The actual installation is, at the moment, simply a matter of cloning the git repository.

Check that you have the necessary dependencies (see below), then take
the following steps:

- copy the templates to their respective names (i.e., remove
  "_template" from their copy). There are four files:

  - tkpweb/settings.py_template

  - tkpweb/apps/database/views.py_tempmlate

  - tkp.cfg_template

  - runserver.bash_template


- edit tkpweb/settings.py:
  
  - verify that you're happy with the default database settings

  - edit the `SECRET_KEY`.

- edit tkpweb/apps/database/views.py:

  - fill out the necessary servers, ports and passwords to access your
    database(s), so that these can be listed and set on the webpages

- edit the tkp.cfg file to point to your default database

- set up a Django database by running::

    python manage.py syncdb

  at the base level

- alter the runserver.bash script to set the `PYTHONPATH` and
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variables correctly.

  You can also add a server name and port at the end of the "python
  manage.py runserver" line; see the django documentation for more
  information.
